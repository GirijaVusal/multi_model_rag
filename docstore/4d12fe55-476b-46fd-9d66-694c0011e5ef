4 Conclusion

Convolutional Neural Networks differ to other forms of Artiﬁcal Neural Net- work in that instead of focusing on the entirety of the problem domain, knowl- edge about the speciﬁc type of input is exploited. This in turn allows for a much simpler network architecture to be set up.

This paper has outlined the basic concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks, explaining the layers required to build one and detailing how best to structure the network in most image analysis tasks.

Research in the ﬁeld of image analysis using neural networks has somewhat slowed in recent times. This is partly due to the incorrect belief surrounding the level of complexity and knowledge required to begin modelling these superbly powerful machine learning algorithms. The authors hope that this paper has in some way reduced this confusion, and made the ﬁeld more accessible to beginners.
